Item 42: Consider emplacement instead of insertion


SUMMARY
* In principle, emplacement functions should sometimes be more efficient than their insertion counterparts, and they should never be less efficient
* In practice, they're most likely to be faster when (1) the value being added is constructed into the container, not assigned, (2) the argument's type(s) passed differ from the type held by the container, and (3) the container won't reject the value being added due to it being a duplicate
* Emplacement functions may perform type conversions that would be rejected by insertion functions
