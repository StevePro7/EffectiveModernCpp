Item 35: Prefer task-based programming to thread-based


SUMMARY
* The std::thread API offers no direct way to get return values from asynchronously run functions, and if those functions throw, the program is terminated
* Thread-based programming calls for manual management of thread exhaustion, oversubscription, load balancing, and adaption to new platforms
* Task-based programming via std::async with teh default launch policy handles most of these issues for you
