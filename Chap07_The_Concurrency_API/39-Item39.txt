Item 39: Consider void futures for one-shot event communication


SUMMARY
* For simple event communication, condvar-based designs require a superfluous metuex, impose constraints on the relative progress of detecting and reacting tasks, and require reacting tasks to verify that the event has taken place
* Designs employing a flag avoid those problems, but are based on polling, not blocking
* A condvar and flag can be used together, but the resulting communications mechanism is somewhat stilted
