Item 36: Specify std::launch::async if asynchronicity is essential


SUMMARY
* The default launch policy for std::async permits both asynchronous and synchronous task execution
* This flexibility leads to uncertainty when accessing thread_locals, implies that the task may never execute, and affects program logic for timeout-based wait calls
* Specify std::launch::async if asynchronous task execution is essential
