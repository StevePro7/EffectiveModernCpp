Item 27: Familiarize yourself with alternatives to overloading on universal references


SUMMARY
* Alternatives to the combination of universal references and overloading include the use of distinct function names, passing parameters by lvalue-reference-to-const, passing parameters by value, and using tag dispatch
* Constraining templates via std::enable_if permits the use of universal references and overloading together, but it controls the conditions under which compilers may use the universal reference overloads
* Universal reference parameters often have efficiency advantages, but they typically have usability disadvantages
