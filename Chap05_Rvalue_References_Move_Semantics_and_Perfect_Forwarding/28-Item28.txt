Item 28: Understand reference collapsing


SUMMARY
* Reference collapsing occurs in four context: template instantiation, auto type generation, creation and use of typedefs and alias declarations, and decltype
* When compilers generate a reference to a reference in a reference collapsing context, the result becomes a single reference.
  If either of the original references is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference.  Otherwise it's an rvalue reference
* Universal references are rvalue references in context where type deduction distinguishes lvalues from rvalues and where reference collapsing occurs
