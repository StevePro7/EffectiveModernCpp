Item 23: Understand std::move and std::forward


SUMMARY
* std::move performs an unconditional cast to an rvalue.  In and of itself, it doesn't move anything
* std::forward casts its argument to an rvalue only if that argument is bound to an rvalue
* Neither std::move nor std::forward do anything at runtime
