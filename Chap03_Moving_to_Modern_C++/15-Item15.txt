Item 15: Use constexpr whenever possible


SUMMARY
* constexpr objects are const and are initialized with values known during compilation
* constexpr functions can produce compile-time results when called with arguments whose values are known during compilation
* constexpr objects and functions may be used in a wider range of contexts than non-constexpr objects and functions
* constexpr is part of an object's or function's interface
