Item 07: Distinguish between () and {} when creating objects


SUMMARY
* Braced initialization is the most widely usable initialization syntax.  It prevents narrowing conversons and it's immune to C++'s most vexing parse
* During constructor overload resolution, braced initializers are matched to std::initializer_list parameters if at all possible, even if other constructors offer seemingly better matches
* An example of where the choice between parentheses and braces can make a significant difference is creating a std::vector<numeric type> with two arguments
* Choosing between parentheses and braces for object creation inside templates can be challenging
