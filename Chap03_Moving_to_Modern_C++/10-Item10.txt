Item 10: Prefer scoped enums to unscoped enums


SUMMARY
* C++ 98-style enums are now known as unscoped enums
* Enumerators of scoped enums are visible only within the enum.  They convert to other types only with a cast
* Both scoped and unscoped enums support specifications of the underlying type.  The default underlying type for scoped enums is int.  Unscoped enums have no default underlying type
* Scoped enums may always be forward-declared.  Unscoped enums may be forward-declared only if their declaration specifies an underlying type
