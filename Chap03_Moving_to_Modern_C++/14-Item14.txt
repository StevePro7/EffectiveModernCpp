Item 14: Declare functions noexcept if they won't emit exceptions


SUMMARY
* noexcept is part of a function's interface, and that means that callers may depend on it
* noexcept functinos are more optimizable thatn non-noexcept functions
* noexcept is particularly valuable for the move operations, swap, memory deallocation functions, and destructors
* Most functions are exception-neutral rather than noexcept
