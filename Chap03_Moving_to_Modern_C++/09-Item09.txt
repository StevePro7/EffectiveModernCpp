Item 09: Prefer alias declarations to typedefs


SUMMARY
* typedefs don't support templatizations but alias declarations do
* Alias templates avoid the "::type" suffix and, in templates, the "typename" prefix often required to refer to typedefs
* C++14 offers alias templates for all the C++11 type traits transformations
