Item 17: Understand special member function generation


SUMMARY
* The special member functions are those compilers may generate on their own: default constructor, destructor, copy operations, and move operations
* Move operations are generated only for classes lacking explicitly declared move operations, copy operations, and a destructor
* The copy constructor is generated only for classes lacking an explicitly declared copy constructor, and it's deleted if a move operation is declared.
  The copy assignment operator is generated only for classes lacking an explicitly declared copy constructor operator and, it's deleted if a move operation is declared.
  Generation of the copy constructor in classes with an explicitly declared destructor is deprecated
* Member function templates never suppress generation of special member functions
