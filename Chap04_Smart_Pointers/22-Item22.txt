Item 22: When using the Pimpl Idiom, define special member functions in the implementation file


SUMMARY
* The Pimpl Idiom decreases build times by reducing compilation dependencies between class clients and class implementations
* For std::unique_ptr pImp pointers, declare special member functions in the class header, but implement them in the implementation file.
  Do this even if the default function implementations are acceptable
* The above advice applies to std::unique_ptr, but not to std::shared_ptr
