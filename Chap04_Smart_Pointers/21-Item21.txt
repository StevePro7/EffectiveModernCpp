Item 21: Prefer std::make_unique and std::make_shared to direct use of new


SUMMARY
* Compared to direct use of new, make functions eliminate source code duplication, improve exception safety, and, for std::make_shared and std::allocate_shared, generated code that's smaller and faster
* Situations where use of make functions is inappropriate include the need to specify custom deleters and a desire to pass braced initializers
* For std::shared_ptrs, additional situations where make functions may be ill-advised include (1) classes with custom memory management and (2) systems with memory concerns, very large objects, and std::weak_ptrs that outlive the corresponding std::shared_ptrs
