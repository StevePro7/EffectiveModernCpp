Item 18: Use std::unique_ptr for exclusive-ownership resource management


SUMMARY
* std::unique_ptr is a small, fast, move-only smart pointer for managing resources with exclusive-ownership semantics
* By default, resource destruction takes place via delete, but custom deleters can be specified.
  Stateful deleters and function pointers as deleters increase the size of std::unique_ptr objects
* Converting a std::unique_ptr to a std::shared_ptr is easy
