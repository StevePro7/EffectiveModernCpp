Item 01: Understanding template type deduction


SUMMARY
* During template type deduction, arguments that are references are treated as non-references, i.e. their reference-ness is ignored
* When deducing types for universal reference parameters, lvalue arguments get special treatment
* When deducing types for by-value parameters, const and/or volatile arguments are treated as non-const and non-volatile
* During template type decudction, arguments that are array or function names decay to pointers, unless they're used to initialize references
