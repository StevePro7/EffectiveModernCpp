Item 03: Understand decltype


SUMMARY
* decltype almost always yields the type of a variable or expression without any modifications
* For lvalue expressions of type T other than names decltype always reports a type of T&
C++14 supports decltype(auto), which like auto, deduces a type from its initializer but it performs the type deduction using the decltype rules
